# LPSL

A compiler for lambda prolog designed to compile to super quick binaries.


LPSL (lambda prolog system language) takes lambda prolog code and converts it into fortran 2008.

If you are like me then you have always been interested in logic programming and what it definitely is not meant for or more specifically systems programming. Have you ever wanted to build an os in prolog, now you can. LPSL is a clone of Teyjus but has support for pointers, variables, more built in predicates, compilation, and support for fortran and c libraries.


- [X] Nonparametric polymorphism at the object level.
- [X] First and higher order terms.

The compiler:

LPSL uses massive number of compiler optimizations ultimately leading up to almost a stochastic superoptimizer that searches for the fastest possible code
in a short sequence. LSPL does this through mandatory modular programming and an already fast compiler having been written in fortran. By default LPSL
uses almost the full optimization capability and because of this every millisecond of compilation speed matters; therefore; LPSL has eager evaluation but is
statically typed.
